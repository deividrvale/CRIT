IRREGULAR

This query demonstrates the nastiness that is possible for "irregular"
systems, where the constraint may contain variables not occurring in
the left-hand side of the rule: with a simple rule, we can decompose
any positive integer value into its prime factors.

Rules like these are legal in LCTRSs, but since they are often not
intended (due to giving hard rules like the one above), you have to
explicitly specify that they are irregular, as demonstrated.
